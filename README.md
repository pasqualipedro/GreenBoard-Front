## About

GreenBook is a web dev application, with front and back development created as Ironhack's third-module bootcamp project.
We had the initial idea of building something that would be useful not only in terms of learning but also something that we could keep in development, adding features.
The choice of theme was made due to the importance that the financial organization, mainly in the scenario of economic and professional uncertainties that we are inserted nowadays.
In addition, the theme is based on the lack of financial education in the basic education that there is in Brazil.
The project is based on an application aimed at the user's financial organization, so that he/she can register all their financial transactions in order to be able to carry out a more detailed monitoring of their expenses and earnings. After completing the user's registration, he is directed directly to a categories screen in which he is allowed to input data from the categories that are part of his financial life, such as House Expenses, Transport Expenses, Salary, Bonuses.
From that, a dashboard is generated, with the listed categories and their respective budgets. The user has the possibility of incrementing transactions, in each of the categories, according to the passage of time and thus have information about his financial life, in a clear and centralized way.
Any questions or suggestions, will be available at the bottom of the page our contacts and the source code of github.
